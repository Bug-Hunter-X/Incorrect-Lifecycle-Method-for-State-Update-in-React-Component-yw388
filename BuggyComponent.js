This React component uses the wrong lifecycle method to update the state. It attempts to update state in `componentDidMount`, which will trigger a re-render, but the state update might be ignored because `componentDidMount` only runs once. Instead, it should use `useState` hook, for functional components or `setState` inside lifecycle methods such as `componentDidUpdate` for class components.
