This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in React: updating component state in the wrong lifecycle method. The `BuggyComponent.js` file showcases the erroneous implementation, where state is updated within `componentDidMount`. This results in the state update being ignored because `componentDidMount` is only called once. In contrast, `FixedComponent.js` demonstrates the correct approach using the `useState` hook, which provides a more effective and straightforward way to manage state updates in functional components.  This example highlights the importance of understanding React's lifecycle methods and using the appropriate ones for state management.
